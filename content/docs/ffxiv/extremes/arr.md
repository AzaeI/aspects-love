- **Head**: Relfects physical ranged, does line aoe damage to tank so position in the corner
- **Tail**: Reflects Magic Damage
- **Melee fine on head or tail**
- Healers avoid peeps due to the aoe damage done to them
- Tidal Roar is the raidwide
- Melee adds cleave
- Kill Gyre Spumes ASAP
- DESTROY Wavetooth (that fear is stupid when rails are down)
- Tethered blue spumes need to be collected by a tank as they will do massive damage to whoever they are attached to which can be heavy mitigated through.

## The Striking Tree

Tanks need 3 stacks of orbs to prevent dying to Shock Strike. One tank while the other collects, then swap and collect.
{{< /alert>}}

- Wake up feared people with 1 (not more as it will kill them) AoE lightning attack
- All targed for "fear" need to be on south part of island for 1 person to wake up
- Kill adds asap
