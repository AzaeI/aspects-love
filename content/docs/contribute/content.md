This site allows contibutors to add types of content: guides and news.

<!--more-->

To understand which type of content to create, it helps to understand the site's definition of each type.

**Guides** are pieces of content that give step by step instructions, or offer tips, for a specific game.

**News** are individual articles that are, but not limited to: reviews, game specific news, industry news, developer news, recommendations, or even a simple "Come play this with me".

You are required to have a **GitHub** account to work with this site. If you need help with that, check out the guide below this one on the left.

## Editing Guides

This site allows for you to edit the guides that exist on the page. Maybe you found a spelling error. Maybe you found a new tip you want to be sure is included. Whatever your reasonings (reasonable reasonings people), you can edit the page it self.

Every guide has a sidebar on the right called "Repository". You can view the page source on **GitHub** or click "Edit this page". It will take you to the repo

## Adding Guides

If the game exists on the left hand side of the Guides page, skip to step two.
