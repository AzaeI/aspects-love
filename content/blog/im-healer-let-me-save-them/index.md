I play a healer main and I got so annoyed that I could not save certain characters in FFXIV when they died in front of me.

This really annoyed me. Let me save them! I can heal them! I heal and raise people all the time! Why won't you let me keep _"insert character here"_?

It turns out there is an actual valid reason for why the Warriors of Light can't save people. When someone "dies" in a dungeon, or raid, or savage, they are actually in a state of being **knocked out** not dead, or dying.

To quote members of the community, "Sadge."
