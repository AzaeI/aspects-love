I play a healer main and I used to become so annoyed that I could not save certain characters in FFXIV when they died in front of me.

To the point in some cutscenes of being almost furious with the game. Let me save them! I can heal them! I heal and raise people all the time! Why won't you let me keep _"insert character here"_?

It turns out there is an actual valid reason for why the Warriors of Light can't save people. When someone "dies" in a dungeon, or raid, or savage, they are actually in a state of being **knocked out** not dead, or dying. This means I am not really a necormancer.

To quote members of the community, "Sadge."
