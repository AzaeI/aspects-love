Several members of the Aspects of Love FC stepped into savage this week. Several different groups, and each has a story of success.

## Hardcore Parkour

We have a few heavy hard core members who are a bit insane. So much so that they spent **11 hours** in P8S on Sunday to get the clear. While that is a bit too steep time wise for myself, I can't help but have a bit of pride for just how crazy they went!

**Massive congratulations to everyone, especially Ray who snagged the mount!**
| Role | Character |

| DPS | Eilaithium Aeglis, Eleyn Shikimori, Ember Shiranui |
| Healers | Sinon Azura, Ray Vermillion (FC Member), Cyrie Odium |

## Just figuring it out

Then you have the group I was in. We started with a few FC members, used Party Finder, and ended the week with a static made of FC members and 3 incredible people from party finder. Tooks a little bit to find our feet, but once we did we cleared P5S Sunday night before enrage hit! That's not too shabby!

**Massive congrats to our new static, aptly called "Inflatable Friends"!**
